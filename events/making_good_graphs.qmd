## Abstract

Making your graph is only the first step, you also have to make it nice to look at. ggplot2 and the related ecosystem of packages provide a wealth of tools to help you do just that. We'll cover a few conventions, some colour theory, some views on what makes good visualisations, and some other resources to learn from, practice with, and be inspired by.
