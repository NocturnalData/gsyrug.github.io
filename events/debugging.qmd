Write enough code and bugs are inevitable. 
In this session we'll cover:

- Using R and RStudio's debugging features to track bugs and errors in your and other people's code
- Defensive strategies to employ in your own code to catch errors as or before they occur
- Ways to rethink errors by adjusting the type of things your functions return

Any slides used in the presentation will be available here shortly before the session.
