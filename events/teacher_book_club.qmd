title: "teachR Book Club"

Our own Adam Rawles has written an introductory book on R available for free here: [https://teacher.arawles.co.uk/](https://teacher.arawles.co.uk/)

We're going to run this as a series of informal discussion sessions. 
Each session will be advertised in advance, and the notice will include what chapters we're going to cover.
You should ideally read the chapters before attending the meeting as we will talk around the chapter, maybe cover a few exercises and discuss putting the content into practice.

These sessions are likely to be run remotely via Zoom or Teams or similar.

More information coming soon.
