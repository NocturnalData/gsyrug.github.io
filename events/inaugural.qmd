In this first meeting, we will be meeting other R users on the island and covering the aims of the Guernsey R Users Group.

As this probably won't take the full time, we'll round off with a quick overview of some of R's object systems, focusing on S3, S4 and the in-development R7.

If you want to join us, sign up on at the Eventbrite page.

Hope to see you there.
